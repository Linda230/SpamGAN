# SpamGAN

The most of the code used here is from the paper "Leveraging GPT-2 for Classifying Spam Reviews with Limited Labeled Data via Adversarial Training"
The source code link can be found at "https://github.com/airesearchuwt/spamGAN"
The modified code is used for my own experimentation, in other words, it is just a try of my ideas.
